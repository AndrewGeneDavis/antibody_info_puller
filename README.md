# antibody_info_puller
A quick web scraper that will take useful information from antibody manufacturer websites and output in csv format for entry into a local database

Currently I have a prototype version that will pull relevant info from Proteintech based on a given url or sets of urls.  Proteintech's website generation and antibody information entry is not uniform across its antibodies, so I need to add more conditioning to handle a range of cases.
